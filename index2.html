    <p class = "paragraphOneAbout">I was born and raised in Ocean County, NJ and have been a local here my entire life. I was a small business owner/ operator in the area for many years, giving me an edge of having specific knowledge of what your business needs and how to market it. This, coupled with my attention to detail, allows me to produce beautiful and valuable web pages that help to uplift the economy in my community. During my experience in my previous profession, Mobile Dog Grooming, I learned a lot of patience. This allows me to take the time and detail needed to craft excellent code. Being a business owner I faced many technological challenges with computers, software, websites, apps, and physical equipment that I was forced to find solutions for on a daily basis- much like finding a bug in code.</p>
    <p class = "paragraphTwoAbout"> In my spare time, I enjoy yoga, time with my software engineer husband Rob, being outdoors, and time with family. I work hard so I can enjoy my life. In every relationship, whether it be client or personal, I add value as much as possible. Your needs are my first priority. When you work with Jackie Regan, you get beautiful, fully responsive, hand-crafted code.</p>
